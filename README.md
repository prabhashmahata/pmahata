! Hello 
@ Myself Prabhash Mahata 
! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University working on Nonadibatic Reaction Dynamics
! My work is diabatization of adibatic electron states and creating the surface which is required for more accurate Quantum Dynamical studies.
! Looking for Machine Learnging ( Neural Network)  project  for the diabatization of adiabats to create PES for large molecule to study nonadiabatic photodissociation dynamics.
